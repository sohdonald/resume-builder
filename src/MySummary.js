SUMMARY
  
With years of combined experience with graphic design, retail, customer service and office work,
I have a knack for being creative and thinking on my feet. A laid-back, but 
active personality that is passioned about working.  

A zest to use my skills to propel my interest in learning new skills and build professional development. 

I hope to apply combined skills to add and move the mission of the organization.
